# RBI2_Kernel

A first attempt at a kernel for the Raspberry Pi 2.
The system require the arm eabi none cross compiler in order to build.
Initial focus on hardware abstraction for GPIO and UART.
Ultimately would like to build a single user multi process kernel for the platform.

Much of this experiment/learning is based off the Bare Metal tutorials on www.valvers.com
